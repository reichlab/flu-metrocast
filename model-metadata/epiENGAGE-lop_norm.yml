methods: "Linear pool (a.k.a. distributional mixture) ensemble of quantile forecast submissions. We use the default settings of the hubEnsembles::linear_pool() function. Before building this ensemble, the quantiles are interpolated into a continuous cumulative distribution function for each forecast. These are combined using a linear pool, and then quasi-random samples are drawn from the resulting ensemble mixture and quantiles are inferred from those empirical samples."

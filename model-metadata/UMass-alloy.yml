data_sources: >
  MetroCast Hub target data (NSSP ED surveillance), 
  CDC ILINet outpatient surveillance data, 
  CDC FluSurv-NET hospitalization data, 
  NHSN hospital flu admissions data, 
  NSSP ED visits data (non-MetroCast Hub locations)
methods: >
  A gradient boosting quantile regression (GBQR) model using MetroCast Hub target data as the primary source with 
  supplementary training from other available influenza surveillance data sources: 
  ILINet outpatient surveillance, FluSurv-NET hospitalization data, 
  NHSN hospital admissions, and NSSP ED visits (including locations not included in the MetroCast Hub). 
  The model uses bagging with 100 bootstrap samples (70% of seasons per bag). 
  Features include Taylor coefficients for trend/curvature estimation, rolling means, lagged values, 
  and one-hot encodings of source, aggregation level, and location. 
  A fourth-root power transform is applied to stabilize variance, with per-location scale and center normalization. 
  Predictions are made jointly across all locations with quantile non-crossing correction applied post-prediction.
  Predictions do not treat the sub-state units as part of the larger state. While the model is fit "jointly", each
  location is treated as exchangeable.

  An AR(6) model with Fourier regression terms to model seasonality. The models

methods_long: "
  This is an AR(6) model fit jointly to all locations using Bayesian methods.
  Prior to model estimation, we perform the following two data transformations:
   1. Take the fourth root.
   2. Scale and center, dividing by the 95th percentile of all weekly values for
      the given location and subsequently subtracting the mean.
  Predictions on the transformed scale are converted back to predictions on the
  original scale by inverting these transformations.
  We incorporate annual seasonal patterns using Fourier harmonics with K=2,
  which adds sine and cosine terms for the first two harmonics of the annual
  cycle (period of 365.25 days). Fourier coefficients and AR parameters are 
  shared across all locations, while variance parameters separate.

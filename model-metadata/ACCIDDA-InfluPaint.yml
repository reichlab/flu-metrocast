methods: "A generative denoising diffusion probabilistic model of Influenza dynamics generates synthetic epidemic trajectories, conditioned on past ground-truth data using an inpainting algorithm. This is a fine-tuned version of the influpaint Flusight model, specifically for the Metrocast regions."
data_sources: "inference on the target data only, but the machine learning model trained on Fluview, FlepiMoP, and SMH projections for the US Flu Scenario modeling hub, then the model is fine-tuned on the Metrocast data."
